## Description

A simple website that was created for a friend of mine that streams frequently on twitch. I noticed He had multiple commands from many Twitch bots that would comment his socials, merch, etc. I seen this and felt like I could help him by creating him a site that could display this all on an easy to use one page site. This website showcases his twitch VOD on the main page, an about me section, his charity work and more.

## Features

This website created for the streamer Direwolfe2 was made to contain all of his social media accounts on one page. Upon loading the page, the user will find an embedded video displaying the twitch stream if the streamer is live and how to connect to his twitch. This was done using the react-twitch-embed npm package.
